# Why PetKennel?

- Sick of Twilight Matriarchs flap-flap-flapping in your face when you craft?
- Wish you could automatically put away your bear when your warden walks into a bank?
- Have you ever apologized in chat for your pet interfering with other players doing their daily crafting writs?

PetKennel automatically dismisses your pet upon interaction with a crafting station, daily crafting writ board, or banker.

# Thank You

Originally inspired by [Dolgubon's Lazy Writ Crafter](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info1346-DolgubonsLazyWritCrafter.html) which implements this same feature, but restricted to only when crafting writs.
